        Move the mouse to control the flashlight. Left click to spawn a new moth. Moths like light. Shine the flashlight on a
        moth to feed it. The moth will try to stay in the light and eat, but don't let it eat too much or it will choke. If it
        doesn't get enough light, it will shrivel and starve. Spawn as many moths as you can handle and try to keep them all
        fed. The more moths you feed, the faster your score will increase. Click to start.
